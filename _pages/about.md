I am **Mehrdad Vasheghani Farahani**, a Research Fellow in the Department of Chemical Engineering at the University of Manchester. 

My work spans:

- Porous media flow and transport phenomena  
- Lattice Boltzmann modelling (LBM)  
- Hydrogen storage and subsurface energy technologies  
- Drying, salt precipitation, and two-phase flow in porous media  
- Multiscale experimental and computational methods  
- High-pressure microfluidics  
- Reactive transport in confined systems  

I collaborate actively with academic and industrial partners and contribute to multiple research projects, including PINCH and IMPRES.

This website collects my research, projects, publications, teaching activities, and personal interests.
