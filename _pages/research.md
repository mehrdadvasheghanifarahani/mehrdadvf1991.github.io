## Research Interests

My research focuses on the fundamental and applied aspects of flow and transport in porous media, including:

- Two-phase flow and wettability effects  
- Multiphase transport in micro- and nano-confined systems  
- Lattice Boltzmann method development  
- Hydrogen generation and storage  
- Drying, salt precipitation, and reactive transport  
- High-resolution pore-scale imaging (microfluidics, X-ray imaging)

## Ongoing Projects

### **PINCH Project (EPSRC EP/W008718/1)**
Work on porous media flow, CO₂ storage, and salt precipitation.

### **IMPRES Research Group**
Modelling and experiments on pore-scale transport, evaporation, and multiphase flow.

### **LBM Modelling Framework**
Custom-built C++ LBM solver with MPI/OpenMP for:
- drying and salt precipitation  
- reactive transport  
- two-phase displacement and capillary phenomena  
- pore-scale velocity and solute transport fields

More details and figures will appear soon.
