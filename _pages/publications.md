A curated list of my peer-reviewed journal papers, conference presentations, book chapters, and preprints will be added here soon.

I am currently preparing manuscripts including:

- *Comparative Evaluation of Models for Non-Fickian Transport in Unsaturated Porous Media*  
- *Pore-scale Dynamics of Convective Brine Drying and Salt Precipitation*  
- Other works on hydrogen generation, evaporative transport, and porous microfluidics.

A formatted list will appear here shortly.
